        <h2>History</h2>
        <article>
            <p>Arsenal's history can be divided into 6 eras, and a summary of each is given below.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1886 - 1919: During this period, the club was founded. The club's name
                    was changed from Dial Square to Royal Arsenal in 1886, Woolwich Arsenal in
                    1893, and then to Arsenal around 1914.
                </li>

                <li>1919 - 1953: The club hired Herbert Chapman to be the manager in 1925, and Arsenal
                    was quite successful on the pitch. Chapman was instrumental in transforming the
                    club and successfully implemented a variation of the W-M formation. Unfortunately,
                    he died in the 1933/34 season. Arsenal lost many players in World War 2 and had a lot of
                    debt from reconstructing a section of the Highbury stadium called the North Bank Stand.
                </li>

                <li>1953 - 1986: The years of mediocrity. Arsenal failed to win a trophy for 18 years. They also
                    lost multiple finals; the only title they won was the 1979 FA Cup.
                </li>

                <li>1986 - 1996: George Graham was the manager, and the club won a few titles. He was fired in
                    1995 because of bribery.
                </li>

                <li>1996 - 2018: The Gunners appointed Ars√©ne Wenger, who is regarded as the best Arsenal manager in
                    history. He made Arsenal an attacking force. French players like Thiery Henry and Patrick Vieira
                    were instrumental to his success. He was the mastermind of "The Invincibles", a nickname given to the
                     Arsenal team that won the 2003/04 season without losing a match. During his tenure, Arsenal won the Premier
                    League 3 times, the FA Cup 7 times and the English Super Cup 7 times. Arsenal also came agonizingly
                    close to winning their first Champions League title in 2006 but was defeated by Barcelona. The club moved
                    to the Emirates Stadium and never reached the same heights they did when they still played at Highbury. Wenger left on 13 May 2018.

                </li>

                <li>2018 - current: After Wenger left, the club hired Unai Emery. Although Arsenal reached the Europa league final
                    under his tenure, the club's overall performance was underwhelming. He was replaced with Mikel Arteta on 20 December 2019. Arteta
                    won the FA Cup in his first season and is the current manager as of writing.
